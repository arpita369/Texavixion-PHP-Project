# Texavixion PHP Project

## Project Overview
Texavixion is the name of my college fest. Every year we need to fill a form for selection of the combo dresses. I have made this form using PHP and phpMyAdmin database. The frontend design is done by using TailwindCSS.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/php1.git`
2. Place the project folder in the `htdocs` directory of XAMPP.
3. Start XAMPP and enable **Apache** and **MySQL**.

## Database Setup
1. Open `phpMyAdmin` in your browser: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
2. Create a new database (e.g., `texavixion`).
3. Import the SQL file from `database/texavixion.sql`.
